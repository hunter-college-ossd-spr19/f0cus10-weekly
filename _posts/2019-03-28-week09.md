title: Cohesion & Repulsion
---
Communities are places where we, as aspiring software engineers, go to grow. Whether it's 48-hour long hackathons or going over some code in the lobby, programmers depend on communities to propel themselves and their ideas forward. As powerful as they are, communities work within a dynamic framework of living individuals -- it cannot be generated, but harnessed. Well, at least according to [Harvard](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/cultivating-communities-of-practice-a-guide-to-managing-knowledge-seven-principles-for-cultivating-communities-of-practice). Like most powerful things, corporations have tried to leverage the power of community -- often creating fake motives to better serve their agenda. Proponents of the *Bazaar* model of software development, like Eric Raymond, have duly noted that a community that is not driven from within is bound to perish. 

## Sticky-ness
The Harvard Study talks about the cohesion aspect in great detail and it would be futile for me to parrot it here. However, I will certainly offer my reflections on the study. *Communities of Practice* grow and expand spontaneously; the supervisors are there to enable it's flow and direction, not steer it. From my personal experience, steering a community towards a direction results in members leaving these communities. In the best circumstances, these members go off to form their own community of practice; in the worst case, they lose interest. 

Interest. Passion. Drive. These are the forces that bring communities together and anyone in a position of influence needs to make sure that these are sustained. A rigid structure, then, is its enemy. As a main character in *The Silent Patient* states, "I will stop doing it once it feels like a chore".
