title: Contentious Crowdsourcing
---
Wikipedia is, perhaps, the most contentious of all the platforms I have ever used. Its open-data nature has allowed it to reach heights that is impossible for products of its nature. Sadly, popularity is not always a blessing. 
In fact, the Linux kernel is the only project I have come across that has maintained its sense of purpose and effectiveness despite its ongoing popularity. Perhaps, it has something to do with the "benevolent dictatorship" paradigm it employs. Regardless, Wikipedia has spawned much controversy and will continue to do so because of clashing ideologies, worldviews, and backgrounds the people contributing to it come from.

Now, Wikipedia does have its rules and regulations to maintain some form of neutrality; but, that can only go so far. Its fifth rule sums its entire process nicely.

## Add to the fire
I had already read the guidelines on contributing to Wikipedia and the primer for newcomers. During my shenanigans around the website, I came across a few **Talk** pages that were mesmerizing; this was because of the nature of debate and interpretation that naturally takes place in such a public forum.

The distinction between contributing to Wikipedia and another open-source/open-data project is that usually the contributions do not have such far reaching precautions. Indubitably, Wikipedia is usually the chief result in response to a search query via Google or other major search engines. It is natural to see, then, the discord that such power spawns. 

Amidst all this chaos -- about which I have written before -- I decided to contribute to the greater community.
