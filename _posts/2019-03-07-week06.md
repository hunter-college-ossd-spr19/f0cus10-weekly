The myth that open source requires the unadulterated attention of its copyright holder is not unfounded. If Kevin Fleming's talk was any indication, determining the right license for copyrights is not a trivial task. 

Thankfully, open source license reviewers such as the OSI and the FSF have done most of the heavylifting for us. 

Why this post, then? Why not visit those forums or watch Fleming's video?

## Analogy
Apart from making an hour-long speech, Fleming makes an analogy between licenses and software itself. The key point he makes is that like software, licenses are not exhaustive -- they do not cover all the edge cases and plug all the possible loopholes. Licenses are, however, useful for protecting your rights to fulfillment. 

Yes. Fulfillment. Or as the English spell it, fulfilment. 

### Extra Intrinsic 
Amongst all the technical details of which license is the most permissive, and how when you edit the license itself you cannot call it the same license, and which license spreads like a virus, he mentioned one important detail -- one of the motivations for licensing your software is to ensure your name is propagated with that piece of software granting you everlasting life. Well, maybe not that dramatic but the idea is similar: making software your legacy.
