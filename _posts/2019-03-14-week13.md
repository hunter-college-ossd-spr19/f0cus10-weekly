The Bazaar model brings out the best in software -- or so Eric Raymond thought. Throughout my excursions into the world of open source, I was more than willing to believe so. But, what about when some congressman rises through the ranks to "change the system" only to be devoured by it? What about people who become what they set out to defeat? I never thought I would meet a such an **ugly** beast in the open-source wall where merit is king. But, I did.

## NextCloud
I did not need to go far beyond the name of the project itself to be disturbed by it -- `NextCloud Server`. The name itself has an ominous ring to it. Perhaps, it reminds me of the days when I would try to understand *MSSQL Server*, in vain. But the constant error messages, the paltry documentation and my cheap computer made the process exponentially difficult. How difficult? It established in me a distaste for **heavy** software. Am I, then, coming from a place of prejudice? Yes. Do you have to squash your prejudice to work in open-source? No, not if I understand "scratching your personal itch" correctly.
