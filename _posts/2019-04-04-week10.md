There comes a time when the passion you show for something is not necessarily reciprocated. The world of open source, much like the real world, has real people in it; people interact with each other, comment on each other's work, discuss new features, fight dragons, and shoot zombies. Okay, maybe not the last two actions.
But, people certainly interact with each other to the same degree as they would in real life. You can imagine, then, that something like the fight from down the street could take place in the open source world, except in a more dramatic fashion with, perhaps, a greater fallout. 
Similarly, that nice lady at the pub could care less about your fishing rod and walk away after you have clearly shown interest; this, too, can be reproduced in the world of open source

## A Fox Story
I have mentioned previously how important mozilla is for the internet. If not, you can hear me say it now 

> Mozilla is important for the internet

Keeping in mind the busywork that goes in for the development of tools like Firefox, Firefox Aurora, Firefox Focus, Fenix, Firefox Send, SpiderMonkey, and loads of other programs that do not have *firefox* in their name, it is understandable that projects like **Common Voice** do not get as much attention. I am not accusing the nicest people over at Mozilla of anything -- even though they did decline my internship application, no hard feelings. Instead, I can see which projects they are prioritizing. When I logged in last on the voice-web repository, I was alarmed to see that some of the pull requests were up there for two days; this gave me an ominous vibe and I shuddered. Of course, I do not believe in superstitions; therefore, I shrugged it off and tried to work through some issues.
