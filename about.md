This is my second re-incarnation on the web. I have been writing since Fall of 2018, when I took an almost identical course and [wrote](https://hunter-college-cs-ossd.github.io/f0cus10-weekly/) about it. I try my best to be insightful during my blogs and represent my thoughts as I continue to journey through the vast world of open source.

Sometimes, I am sceptical of open-source, and at other times, I am just amazed by how a community manages to write incredibly complex software without any preset architecture.
